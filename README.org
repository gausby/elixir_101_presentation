*** Books
If you are only going to buy two Elixir books I would recommend:

**** Programming Elixir by Dave Thomas
Does an excellent job of teaching pattern matching and recursive functions and thinking, but it does not go into great detail of processes, supervision, OTP, and the like.

**** Elixir in Action by Saša Jurić
If you have read Programming Elixir by Dave Thomas you should pick up Jurić's book and skip the first part. This one does a great job of explaining OTP. Not only does it tell you how, but it also gives an answer to they whys.

*** IRC
**** #cphex on freenode
**** #elixir-lang on freenode
